 basketball_stats_tool

This application takes in a imported list of constants and separates them into teams for basketball.



 I was going to try for an exceeds grade but I kept having issues with the height as well as the count of experienced vs not experienced not showing up at all or popping up errors saying that it wasn't already made.
 I left the def's for height that I made to try and calculate the teams height but idk why they wouldn't work. the experienced vs non-exp was too much of a mess.
